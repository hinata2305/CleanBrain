Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,

This computer code is designed to optimize a temporal filter for a specific psychological experiment. It requires a test dataset to generate a predictor time course, 
as well as a retest dataset for filter parameter optimization, and vice versa. This process is executed in the script find_filter.m.
Subsequently, another dataset must be utilized to assess whether the obtained filters indeed enhance the test-retest reliability of the experiment, 
which is conducted in the test_filter.m script.

Within the folder, you will find both a German and an English white paper that provide detailed descriptions of how the package functions.

Best regards,
Jan
